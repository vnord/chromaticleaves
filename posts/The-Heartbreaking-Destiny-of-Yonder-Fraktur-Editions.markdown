These beautiful editions of Hesse's main works have been gathering dust on
our top shelf for quite some time now (as have Goethe's collected works, too -
but let's leave the discussion of that for another time). As you can see,
the printing is just delightful. As you can not see, the paper is also wonderful
and smells just like paper from the fifties should.

The Fraktur script is often associated with the Nazis, but many do not know that
it was in fact banned by the regime in 1941.
